# Rock Paper Scissors
  
## Introduction
This project was to create a rock paper scissors game that would rely on a user selection and a randomly generated computer selection to establish your 'fighters'. By creating both a player(player.js) and game(game.js) class, this project continued to build on our mod 1 fundamentals as we connected these data models to the DOM. The standard rock, paper, scissors version of the game can be started by clicking the classic button, or a difficult version of the game with five fighters can be started with a click  on its button.
